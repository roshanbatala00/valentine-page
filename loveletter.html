  <h1>HAPPY VALENTINE’S DAY, MERI PYARI 💗</h1>
  <p>Dear Pujana,</p>
  <p>Once again, Happy Valentine’s Day, my love — meri pukuli, meri budi jeu. 🌷<br>
  You carry a tiny spark of anger sometimes, but when that spark turns into a storm, it can lift Sagarmatha itself. Yet even then, you remain the most beautiful soul — pure, rare, and flawless, without a single doubt.</p>
  
  <p>And me? I know I am stubborn, foolish, and far from perfect. But for you, my love, I have never held back even a single drop of effort. I speak too much when emotions overflow, but I swear on my heart — whether I laugh or cry, every word I say is soaked in love for you.</p>

  <p>I love you… endlessly, hopelessly, madly. 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗</p>

  <p>No matter how flawed my habits may be, I am learning, changing, becoming better — for you, and for us. Because now, my life has only one destination: you.<br>
  I want to marry you, build a small world together, fill it with laughter, dreams, and tiny footsteps of our future children. You and me, working side by side, holding hands through every storm, making a warm home out of love and patience.</p>

  <p>And listen to me, my brave girl — do not burden your heart with too much pressure. I see your struggle, your late nights, your silent tears, and your unstoppable effort. And I swear, I am so damn proud of you. You are stronger than you realize, braver than you believe, and brighter than you know.</p>

  <p>Your dreams are not in vain. Every step you take is building the life you deserve. One day, all your pain will bloom into success, and I will be standing beside you, applauding the loudest.</p>

  <p>Forget the noise of the world. You are more than enough.<br>
  You are my peace, my chaos, my dream, my home.<br>
  You are my entire universe wrapped in a single heartbeat.</p>

  <p>And till my last breath fades into silence, I promise —<br>
  I will love you. Always. Only you. Forever.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:1.5em; color:#d81b60;">I LOVE YOU INFINITELY. 💖🌸</p>
